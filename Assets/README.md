## Description

This application is designed for the people who have no idea what to do on their nights off! This application is simple to use, 
all you have to do is push a button and it will generate both an activity for you to do, as well as a drink that you could make 
or learn to make. 

## Usage

To start please click the "So, what are we doing tonight?" button.

feel free to click the generate button to get a new activity or drink. If you like one in particular and would like to come back to
 it you can add it to your favorites!
